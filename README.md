demo_1: Dewei's old code https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UBhen5lmalaFdH8CmSnuMtHbKxyRhbP5, using only contrastive learning
- (TO-DO) add inference code
demo_2: cloves + cumin + oregano wih transformer, highest accuracy = about 0.626


deploy: Realtime Data Collection and Prediction for Live Demo
- run.py: collect data with run.py 
- monitor.py: show realtime collection visualization 
    - (TO-DO) make realtime visualization better
- infer.py: add correct directory of model to checkpoints and the realtime data collected, run infer.py to predict
    - (TO-DO) add realtime prediction code
